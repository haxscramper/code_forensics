- [ ] Allow passing extra configuration options to the executed blame
  subprocess - there are many flags for ignoring certain commits, something
  for line similarity etc. All of this must be configurable
- [ ] Support different resolutions for the sampling and period assignment.
  For example, I want to sample commits on a quarterly basis, but still
  divide the whole timeline on the yearly basis. Plotting this is
  relatively easy - the build would just put two bars per single table
  column - but the periods might be off.
- [ ] Store information about modified files for each commit in order to
  provide hotspot analysis.
  - this might be used to speed up the change analysis - only refresh files
    that changed between two sample points, otherwise just copy the data as
    it is now.
